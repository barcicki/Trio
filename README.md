## Game modes

### Classic Trio
It is played using all 81 cards. 12 of them are put on a table. Once Trio is found, three cards are replaced with new ones from the deck. If there's no Trio on new table, system automatically adds as many cards as needed to have at least one Trio on a table. Game ends when there's no Trio on a table and there's no card to add from the deck.

### Triple Trio
Quicker than ClassicTrio. Find three hidden Trios on the table.

### Speed Trio
Time-limited version of Classic Trio. You've got 2 minutes to find as many Trios as possible.
